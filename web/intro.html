	Hello! My name is Angelo Pablo. This Is currently my fourth semester in BYU-I. I am studying Software Engineering as a major and I am studying Chinese for fun. I enjoy running and swimming as it pertains to sports. My favorite thing to do is make puns and do magic tricks, but yeah that is my life.
